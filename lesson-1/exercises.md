let name = prompt("What is your name?");
console.log(name)
```

3. Write a program that prints all prime numbers to 100. e.g 2, 3, 5, 7, ...
4. Print all the fibonacci numbers to 50. e.g. 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, ...
5. Write a program that asks the user two numbers, multiply and print the result. (First exercise will help you). e.g. 5 + 5 = 10
6. Write a program that calculates the area of triangle, where base is equal 5 and height is equal 5
7. Write a program that prints the last digit of a given integer. e.g.
```
let number = 250303042332

//print result 2
```
8. Write a program that asks the user the year he was born and print his age.


## Level 2 - Normal
9. Write a program that asks the user when he was born and print his age.
10. Write a program that reads a number that you want to get the sum until that number. e.g. 1+2+3+4...+98+99+100 = 5050
```
// reads the number you want to sum (first exercise you will help)
// calculates the sum of 1+2+3+4...+98+99+100+n
// print the result
```
11. Write a program that reads 5 numbers and prints if the nubmer is negative or positive

## Level 3 - Hard
13. An internet cafe has 1 way of charging. The user has to pay 5$/hour. Calculate the price based on how many hours the user spend. If the user spent 10 hours or more, give him 10% of discount

    Create a program that:

    * Reads how many hours the user spend
    * Give the discount if needed
    * Print the total amount the user has to pay
    * Output: "The user stayed 10 hours for 5$/hour minus the 10% discount, the * total amount is $45"
    * Output2: "The user stayed 4 hours for 5$/hour, the total amount is $20"
